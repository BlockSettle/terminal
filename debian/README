# PREPARE A RELEASE

	1. Clone git sources of terminal (reusable):

		$ git clone https://github.com/BlockSettle/terminal.git .
		$ cd terminal
		$ python ./generate.py -download-only

	2. Generate new changelog entry:

		$ debian/utils prepare

	3. (Optional) Save changelog to version control:

		$ git commit -m "New debian package" -- debian/changelog

	4. (Optional) Create source package for unstable:

		$ debian/utils rebuild

# REBUILD BACKPORTS

Previous scenarios manage universal packaging artifacts. They're suitable for local builds.
But for launchpad per-release artifacts should be built.

	5. Rebuild backports artifacts for different releases:

		$ debian/utils backports

	By default it will create backports for: bionic cosmic disco and xenial releases.
	It should create bunch of .dsc .debian.tar.xz for different releases. .orig.tar.gz reused with same name.

# TEST LOCAL BUILDS

Should be done independently for each backport:

	6. Create chroot environments for clean rebuld (requires root privileges, reusable):

		# distrib='bionic'
		# pbuilder create --distribution ${distrib} --basetgz /var/cache/pbuilder/${distrib}.tgz --debootstrapopts --variant=buildd

	7. Run build:

		# package='terminal'
		# pbuilder build --basetgz /var/cache/pbuilder/${distrib}.tgz ../${pacakge}~${distrib}.dsc

	8. Once build completed packages check them:

		$ cd /var/cache/pbuilder/result

	9. In order to speed-up builds follow instructions in article about `tmpfs` and `ccache` usage:

		https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PbuilderHowto

# DEB-SIGN PACKAGES

Should be done independently for each backport:

	10. Unpack sources:

		$ dpkg-source -x ./<package>_<version>-<release>~<distrib>1.dsc

	11. Repack sources with signing:

		$ cd ./<package>_<version>
		$ debuild -S -sa -d

	It should regenerate .dsc file and additionally generate .changes files.

# UPLOAD FOR BUILD

Should be done independently for each backport:

	12. Upload sources:

		$ dput ppa:blocksettle/<repository> ../<package>_<version>-<release>~${distrib}1_source.changes

	If everything goes fine packages will be scheduled for build and publishing.
	There will be mail message with upload status sent to email address associated with Launchpad-account.
